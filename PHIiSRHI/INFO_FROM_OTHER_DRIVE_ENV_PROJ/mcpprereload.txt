> resume 

● I can see you're working with PhiWave (formerly MindstateClone), a binaural beats and isochronic tones audio
  synthesis tool. You've typed "resume" - could you clarify what you'd like me to help you with?

  Looking at your git status, I can see you have several modified files and many untracked files. Are you looking
  to:

  1. Resume working on a specific feature or task?
  2. Continue with a previous conversation or workflow?
  3. Review or commit your current changes?
  4. Something else?

  Please let me know what you'd like to work on, and I'll be happy to help!

● I'll help you resume your previous workflow. Let me check for any instructions or context about what you were
  working on.

● Read(AFTER_RELOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt)
  ⎿  Read 35 lines

● Read(test_mcp_after_reload.md)
  ⎿  Read 155 lines

● Read(PHASE3_COMPLETION_REPORT.txt)
  ⎿  Read 323 lines

● Perfect! I can see you were working on testing the PhiWave Agent Hub MCP server integration. Let me resume from
  where you left off.

  Based on the instructions in AFTER_RELOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt, I need to:

  1. ✓ Read the test plan (done)
  2. Check if MCP server tools are available
  3. Run the 8-step test sequence
  4. If successful, integrate with the Junie agent

  Let me start by checking if the MCP tools are loaded and verify the configuration:

● Read(.mcp.json)
  ⎿  Read 12 lines

● Bash(claude mcp list)
  ⎿  No MCP servers configured. Use `claude mcp add` to add a server.

● I can see the issue - the .mcp.json file exists with the correct configuration, but Claude Code hasn't loaded it
  yet. The MCP server needs to be registered. Let me add it:

● Bash(claude mcp add phiwave-agent-hub --type stdio --command "E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave\.venv\Scripts\python.exe"
      "E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave\mcp_agent_hub.py")
  ⎿  Error: error: unknown option '--type'

● Bash(claude mcp add --help)
  ⎿  Usage: claude mcp add [options] <name> <commandOrUrl> [args...]

     Add an MCP server to Claude Code.
     … +20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I see the correct syntax. Let me add the MCP server with the proper format:

● Bash(claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope project phiwave-agent-hub
      "E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" "E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave\mcp_agent_hub…)
  ⎿  Error: MCP server phiwave-agent-hub already exists in .mcp.json

● The MCP server is already configured in .mcp.json. Let me verify the server works locally first, then we'll need
  to reload Claude Code to pick up the MCP tools:

● Bash(timeout 3 .venv/Scripts/python.exe mcp_smoke_test.py)
  ⎿  Running MCP Hub local smoke test...

     [OK] init_db
     … +9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good news! The MCP hub local functionality works perfectly. The smoke test passed with 7 messages in the database.

  Issue: Claude Code hasn't loaded the MCP server tools yet. I can see the server is configured in .mcp.json, but
  the tools (like mcp__phiwave_agent_hub__get_stats, etc.) are not available in my current session.

  Let me check if there's a reload script:

● Read(RELOAD_CLAUDE_MCP_TEST.bat)
  ⎿  Read 75 lines

● Status Update: MCP Server Testing

  Current Status:
  - ✅ MCP server configured in .mcp.json
  - ✅ Local smoke test PASSED (7 messages, 2 agents in database)
  - ❌ MCP tools NOT YET LOADED in Claude Code session

  The Problem:
  I don't have access to the MCP tools yet. I should see tools like:
  - mcp__phiwave_agent_hub__get_stats
  - mcp__phiwave_agent_hub__post_message
  - mcp__phiwave_agent_hub__get_messages
  - etc.

  But these tools are not available in my current session.

  What You Need to Do:

  Option 1: Reload Claude Code (Recommended)
  1. Close this Claude Code window
  2. Reopen Claude Code
  3. Navigate back to E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave
  4. Type resume or tell me: "Read test_mcp_after_reload.md and run the test sequence"

  Option 2: Try /reload command
  Simply type /reload in the chat to reload Claude Code without closing the window.

  ---
  After reload, I will:
  1. Verify MCP tools are loaded (check for mcp__phiwave_agent_hub__* tools)
  2. Run the full 8-step test sequence from test_mcp_after_reload.md
  3. Verify database operations work via MCP
  4. Confirm stats, messaging, and search functionality
  5. If successful, proceed to Junie agent integration

  Current Database State:
  - Total messages: 7
  - Total agents: 2 (SmokeTester, ClaudeCode)
  - Unread messages: 6
  - Database path: E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave\agent_hub.db

  Would you like to reload now?

> yes 

● Perfect! Let me create a todo list for the MCP testing workflow, then guide you through the reload process.

● 🔄 Reload Instructions

  Step 1: Close Claude Code
  - Save this conversation if needed
  - Close the Claude Code application completely

  Step 2: Reopen Claude Code
  - Launch Claude Code again
  - Navigate to: E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave

  Step 3: Resume Testing
  Once you're back in a new session, simply type:
  resume

  Or tell me:
  Read test_mcp_after_reload.md and run the test sequence

  📋 What I'll Do After Reload

  When you return, I will automatically:

  1. ✅ Verify MCP Tools Loaded - Check for 8 tools with mcp__phiwave_agent_hub__ prefix
  2. ✅ Run Test Sequence - Execute all 8 tests from the test plan:
    - Get initial stats (expect ~7 messages, 2 agents)
    - Post a new message from ClaudeCode
    - Retrieve messages (verify new message appears)
    - Get agent status (should show SmokeTester + ClaudeCode)
    - Search for "test" keyword
    - Mark a message as processed
    - Verify unread count decreased
    - Confirm all operations successful
  3. ✅ Document Results - Create a test report
  4. ✅ Next Steps - If successful, proceed to Junie agent integration
