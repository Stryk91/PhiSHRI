# PhiVector

Bricklayer for 15 years. Now is the f**kin time.

**"The fastest way to do something is to do it once. No matter how slow you are."**  
— My old boss (not the finest human, but damn he knew how to run a crew)

PhiVector is my personal war machine: a lean, file-based multi-agent system that lets one person run a small swarm of AIs without paying enterprise tax.

No dashboards for the sake of dashboards. No React for the sake of React. Just scripts, files, and glue that **works the first time**.

## What PhiVector Does

- Coordinates multiple agents:
  - Desktop Claude
  - VS Code Claude
  - Kali/WSL Claude
  - Browser Claude
  - External AI (NINJA)
  - Human in the loop (STRYK)

- Uses simple primitives:
  - File-based state as the "bus"
  - PowerShell + AutoHotkey on Windows
  - Bash on WSL/Kali
  - Cheap/free AI endpoints first, pay later if you must

- Optimizes for:
  - Fewer tokens (I've seen ~66% reduction)
  - Fewer clicks
  - Fewer things that can break
  - **Doing it once, doing it right**

## Design Rules

- **Interoperability first**  
  Why make something if you need 5 different shells and syntaxes just to install it?

- **File first**  
  If it can be expressed as a file + script, that's the default.

- **Free-tier first**  
  Burn free limits, then rotate providers.

- **Human stays in charge**  
  Agents can do a lot, but they don't get root access to your life.

- **UI when it matters**  
  I'm not anti-UI. I'm anti-bullshit-UI. If a clean interface makes the system more usable, I'll build it.

## Who This Is For

- Solo operators and power users who:
  - Hate repetitive bullshit
  - Want things to work the first time
  - Value interoperability over "platform lock-in"
  - Don't want to click around dashboards when a script will do

If you want pretty for the sake of pretty, this isn't it.  
If you want something you can actually wire into your life and have it **just work**, you're in the right place.

## The Bricklaying Connection

15 years laying brick taught me:
- **Min-maxing**: Do the most work in the least hours by not having to redo shit
- **Sequence thinking**: Stage materials, plan the flow, execute clean
- **Quality over speed**: Slow and right beats fast and wrong every time
- **Crew efficiency**: Our crew worked the least hours, did the most work, and pulled the least walls down

Now I apply that to AI automation.
