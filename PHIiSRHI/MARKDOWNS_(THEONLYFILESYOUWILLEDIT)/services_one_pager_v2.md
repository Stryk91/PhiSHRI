# Services – AI & Automation Work I Actually Want To Do

I'm not here to be your full-stack dev or your corporate "AI strategist".

I build **scripts and systems** that work the first time.

- Background: 15 years bricklaying (min-maxing, sequence thinking, doing it right)
- Now: PowerShell / AutoHotkey / Bash / basic security
- Philosophy: **"The fastest way to do something is to do it once. No matter how slow you are."**
- Goal: Enough to pay bills + fund AI tools (~$400/week)

If you want fancy dashboards and meetings, I'm not your guy.  
If you want practical automation that **just works**, read on.

## 1. AI Workflow Automation (PowerShell / AHK)

**What I do**

Take a repetitive workflow you hate and wire AI + scripts around it so you **never have to do it manually again**.

Examples:
- Auto-send files from VS Code to an AI, save responses back to disk
- Generate summaries or reports from log folders
- Turn a manual "open browser → log in → copy/paste → save result" into a macro + script

**Tech I use**
- PowerShell (Windows)
- AutoHotkey
- File-based state (JSON in folders)
- Whatever AI tools you already use (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

**What you get**
- Scripts + small config files
- A short "how to run this" text file
- Clean interfaces when they help (I'm not anti-UI, I'm anti-bullshit-UI)
- **One install process, not five different shells**

**Good fit if:**
- You're on Windows
- You know what hurts in your workflow
- You're fine editing a config and running scripts
- You want it to work the first time

**Pricing:** $200-400 depending on complexity

## 2. Free-Tier AI Cost Optimizer

**What I do**

Make your AI usage cheaper and less wasteful through **smart routing and batching**.

Examples:
- Rotate between different providers' free tiers
- Batch multiple prompts into one call when it makes sense
- Cache & reuse context so you don't re-send the same stuff 20 times

**Tech I use**
- Simple scripts (PowerShell/Bash)
- Config files for your providers
- Logging so you can see what's happening

**What you get**
- Scripts to route calls between providers
- A basic text report: "before vs after" token/cost estimates
- Ideas on where you can save more
- **System that runs itself once set up**

**Good fit if:**
- You're hitting rate limits or paying more than you like
- You're okay with a bit of setup to save money long-term
- You want a system that works without constant babysitting

**Pricing:** $150-300

## 3. Security / Monitoring Automation (Small Scale)

I'm not selling "enterprise SOC". I'm interested in **practical security** for small setups.

**What I do**
- Basic IPsec / firewall rules
- Simple monitoring scripts (log watching, alerts)
- Automated small-scale scans (nmap, basic scan flows)
- Glue between your tools and AI so you can ask "what's going on here?" and get a useful summary

**Tech I use**
- PowerShell / Bash
- Common tools (nmap, simple log watchers)
- AI for summarizing / analyzing outputs

**What you get**
- Scripts + config
- A rough but honest explanation of what's now being watched
- Ideas for next steps if you want to go deeper
- **Systems that alert you when shit's wrong, not constantly**

**Good fit if:**
- You're running a small setup (personal, small business)
- You want basic security without enterprise overhead
- You value practical over perfect

**Pricing:** $300-600 depending on scope

## 4. Custom Tool/Dashboard (When UI Actually Helps)

Sometimes a clean interface **does** make things better. I'm not anti-UI — I'm anti-bullshit-UI.

**What I do**
- Build terminal-based dashboards (like the system monitor you saw)
- Create simple web interfaces when they serve a purpose
- Design logos and branding when needed
- Focus on **interoperability**: one install, not five shells

**Examples:**
- System monitoring dashboard (terminal-based, real-time)
- Tool launcher with clean interface
- Status displays for multi-agent systems

**Tech I use**
- Python (terminal UIs)
- HTML/CSS/JS (when web makes sense)
- SVG for logos and graphics

**What you get**
- Clean, functional interface
- Easy to install and run
- Documentation that actually helps

**Good fit if:**
- You need a UI but hate bloated frameworks
- You value function over form (but want both when possible)
- You want something that looks professional without being corporate

**Pricing:** $400-800 depending on complexity

## How I Work

- **Communication**: Prefer async (text). Short calls only if needed.
- **OS**: Mostly Windows + WSL/Kali. Linux server is fine.
- **Delivery**: Git repo / zip with scripts + README.
- **Style**: Plain language, no corporate theatre.
- **Philosophy**: Do it once, do it right. No pulling walls down.

## Pricing Reality

Money is not the main goal. I'd be happy around **$400/week** doing this kind of work.

So my pricing is honest:
- Small jobs: **$150-300**
- Medium setups: **$300-500**
- Bigger projects: **$500-800+**

If you're cash-strapped but the project is interesting and aligns with what I'm already building, I'm open to adjusting.

**Volume discount**: If you have multiple small jobs, we can work out a package deal.

## If You Want to Work With Me

When you reach out, please include:

1. **Your OS** (Windows / Mac / Linux)
2. **The one workflow or problem that annoys you the most**
3. **What tools you're already using** (VS Code, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
4. **Whether you care more about time saved or money saved**
5. **Your budget range** (be honest, I'm flexible)

Then we figure out:
- Is this something I can improve with scripts + AI?
- What's the minimum viable thing we can build to prove it works?
- How do we make sure it works the first time?

I'm not trying to impress HR. I'm trying to make computers do more of the work so you can do more of what matters.
