# Evaluation Kit: Testing BN vs ISO and Noise Effects

## A/B Test Plan
- **Goal**: Compare binaural (BN) vs isochronic (ISO) and noise vs no-noise for focus (e.g., 13 Hz beat, 100 Hz carrier, 20-min session), based on mixed evidence for entrainment ([Ingendoh et al., 2023]; [Aparecido-Kanzler et al., 2021]).
- **Design**: Within-subjects, counterbalanced; 4 conditions: BN no-noise, BN with pink noise (mix 0.3), ISO no-noise, ISO with noise. 10–20 participants; 1 session/condition, 1–2 days apart.
- **Procedure**: Randomize order; same time/day, device, volume (equal loudness via pretest). 5-min baseline, session, task (e.g., sustained attention test), log immediately + 15 min later.
- **Metrics**: Subjective Likert (below); optional EEG if available. Analyze differences via paired t-tests or ANOVA.
- **Bias Tips**: Blind conditions (label A/B/C/D); standardize environment (quiet, dim); no expectations shared; calibrate volume for perceived equality.

## Listening Log Rubric
Rate each on 1–7 Likert (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree):

- Relaxation: I felt more relaxed during/after.
- Focus: My concentration improved.
- Drowsiness: I felt sleepy or fatigued.
- Physical Comfort: No discomfort (headache, ear strain).
- Pulsing Clarity: The beat/pulse felt clear and engaging.
- After-Effects (15 min later): Positive lingering effects (e.g., calm/alert).

Notes: Open text for qualitative feedback.
