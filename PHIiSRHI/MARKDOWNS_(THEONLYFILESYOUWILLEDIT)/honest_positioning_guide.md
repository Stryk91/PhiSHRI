# Honest Positioning Guide - No Embellishment

## Your Actual Field

**What you actually are:**
> Someone who thinks in **pipelines and sequences** (15 years bricklaying), now applying that to **AI automation** because you hate repetitive annoying work.

**What you actually do:**
- Build **PowerShell/AutoHotkey scripts** that make multiple AI instances work together
- Design **file-based coordination** between desktop tools, VS Code, WSL, browser
- Optimize for **zero cost** (free tiers, token reduction, provider rotation)
- Focus on **workflow logic** not pretty interfaces
- Comfortable with security work: IPsec, monitoring, pen testing, surveillance

**What you actually want:**
- $1k/week
- Most work automated/scripted/voice-commanded
- No front-end, no corporate politics, no phone calls, no facade
- Remote work so you can live life

## Honest Bios (3 Versions)

### Version 1: GitHub/Portfolio (Hacker Audience)
```
Former bricklayer (15 years) → now building AI automation pipelines.

I design multi-agent coordination systems using PowerShell, file-based state, 
and zero-cost optimization strategies. 23 days in, already running 4 OS 
environments across 3 machines with 6-agent orchestration.

Focus: Make work less annoying. Automate everything. Free-tier first.

Current project: PhiVector - lean multi-agent system for solo operators.
```

### Version 2: Client-Facing (Solo Founders/Small Teams)
```
I automate repetitive work using AI agents and PowerShell scripts.

What I do:
- Set up multi-agent AI workflows (desktop, VS Code, Linux, browser)
- Reduce token costs through batching and provider rotation
- Build file-based coordination systems (no heavy infrastructure)
- Focus on PowerShell/AutoHotkey automation

Background: 15 years planning efficient pipelines on construction sites.
Now I apply the same thinking to AI workflows.

Good fit for: Solo founders who want to do more with less, hate dashboards,
and need practical automation without enterprise bloat.
```

### Version 3: Job Application (AI Tools Company)
```
Background: 15 years as bricklayer designing efficient work sequences.
Now: Building multi-agent AI coordination systems (23 days in).

Technical focus:
- PowerShell scripting & Windows automation
- Multi-agent orchestration (file-based state management)
- Cost optimization (free-tier rotation, token reduction)
- System integration (desktop, VS Code, WSL, browser)
- Security: IPsec, monitoring, pen testing

Projects:
- PhiVector: Multi-agent coordination for solo operators
- CASCADE Protocol: Systematic problem-solving decision tree
- Cost-optimized AI workflows (66% token reduction achieved)

What I'm good at:
- Back-end/infrastructure/automation
- Workflow design and optimization
- Making systems run with minimal human attention
- Security and monitoring work

What I'm not:
- Front-end developer
- Corporate politics player
- Long phone call person

Best role: Systems/automation engineer focused on AI orchestration,
working independently on infrastructure and workflow optimization.

## What Your Work Actually Shows

**CASCADE Protocol** = You think in **decision trees and systematic execution**
- Binary choices (no analysis paralysis)
- Structured fallbacks
- Iteration with failure analysis
- This is **bricklayer thinking**: staging, sequence, load-bearing constraints

**Landing Page** = You can **execute on aesthetics** when needed
- First webpage ever, but you nailed the tactical/chrome aesthetic
- SVG work, gradients, animations - you figured it out
- Not a "designer" but you can **make it work**

**PhiVector** = You're building **practical infrastructure**
- File-based (simple, robust)
- Multi-agent (desktop, VS Code, WSL, browser, you, human)
- Cost-optimized (free-tier rotation)
- No enterprise bloat

## Reality Check

**What you can realistically charge (starting out):**
- First 3 clients: $200-300 per project
- Next 10 clients: $300-500 per project
- After 15 projects: $500-800 per project

**Timeline to $1k/week:**
- Month 1-2: Build portfolio, get first 3 clients ($600-900 total)
- Month 3-4: Refine offerings, get 5-7 more clients ($1500-3500 total)
- Month 5-6: Raise prices, get 2-3 clients/week ($1000-1500/week)

**What will actually be hard:**
- Finding first clients (expect 50+ outreach messages)
- Pricing yourself (you'll undercharge at first)
- Saying no to scope creep
- Not getting discouraged after rejections

**What will actually be easy:**
- Delivering value (you already know how to build this stuff)
- Standing out (your background is unique)
- Learning new things (you've proven you can learn fast)
- Being honest (you're already doing this)
