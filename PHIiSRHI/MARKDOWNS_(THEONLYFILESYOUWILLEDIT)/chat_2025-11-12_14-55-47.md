## Conversation Summary

This conversation covered the development and enhancement of the Script Launcher GUI (v2.4), implementing multiple features:

### Key Accomplishments:

1. **Comprehensive Dependency Checker**
   - Enhanced from 10 hardcoded tools to pattern-based detection
   - Detects 60+ critical tools across categories (terminal emulators, interpreters, network tools, etc.)
   - Validates shebang interpreters
   - Optimized for performance while remaining thorough
   - Fixed issue where xterm was marked as "OK" but wasn't installed

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Separated `scan_scripts()` from `refresh_tree_view()`
   - Eliminated unnecessary full rescans on single-script operations
   - Mark LOCAL: Updates only affected script's data
   - Make executable: Updates only affected script's data
   - Remove: Updates only list in memory
   - Result: Operations are now instant instead of re-scanning all 265+ scripts

3. **Multi-Script Type Support**
   - Added support for .bat (Windows Batch) files
   - Added support for .ps1 (PowerShell) files
   - Maintained existing .sh (Shell script) support
   - Updated scanner, CSV import, backups, and add script features

4. **Manual Script Addition**
   - "➕ Add Script" button with location selector
   - Quick access to Home, C:, D:, E:, /mnt/, Root drives
   - File type filtering for .sh, .bat, .ps1
   - Smart validation and overwrite protection
   - Only analyzes new script (no full rescan)

5. **LOCAL Script Protection System**
   - Added tagging system: `# @SCRIPT_LAUNCHER_LOCAL`
   - New 🔒 column in tree view
   - "🔒 Mark LOCAL" and "🔓 Unmark" buttons
   - Protected purge with two-tier confirmation
   - Detailed breakdown of LOCAL vs IMPORTED scripts during purge

6. **Purge System with Backups**
   - Automatic daily backups on startup
   - Manual "🗑 PURGE ALL" button
   - Creates backup before purge
   - Protects LOCAL scripts (requires extra confirmation)
   - Detailed logging of deleted/protected/failed scripts

7. **OS/Container Detection**
   - New "🖥 OS/Container" column
   - "🖥 Parse OS" button to analyze all scripts
   - Detects: Windows/CMD, Windows/PowerShell, Linux/Bash, WSL/Bash, macOS/Bash, macOS/Zsh, Unix/Bash, Linux/Docker, Linux/K8s, Python, Perl, Ruby, Node.js
   - Smart detection based on file extension, shebang, and content analysis
   - Distinguishes between macOS, Linux, and WSL environments

### Technical Details:

**File Structure:**
```
script-launcher-gui/
├── launcher_v2.py (main application - 2000+ lines)
├── backups/ (automatic daily backups)
│   └── backup_2025-11-12_*.tar.gz
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── README.md
├── FEATURES.md
└── CSV_IMPORT_GUIDE.md
```

**Current Status:**
- Version: v2.4+
- Scripts managed: 265+
- Supported types: .sh, .bat, .ps1
- OS detection: 14+ target platforms
- Launcher PID: 31719
- Running in: WSL2 (Kali Linux)

### Bootstrap System Discovery:

Found completed Claude Bootstrap System v1.0 in `/home/STRYK/claude-bootstrap/`:
- ✅ claude_bootstrap.sh - Interactive setup wizard
- ✅ claude_member_config.json - Configuration template
- ✅ onboarding_prompt.md - Manual onboarding
- ✅ continuity_log.md - Shared state tracking
- ✅ README.md - Complete documentation

**Status**: Fully functional, core components complete, pending full testing across all Claude instances (TERMC, DC, WEB_CLAUDE).

**Purpose**: Universal onboarding and continuity system for multi-instance Claude workflows, providing member identity, baseline configuration, context awareness, and seamless handoffs.
