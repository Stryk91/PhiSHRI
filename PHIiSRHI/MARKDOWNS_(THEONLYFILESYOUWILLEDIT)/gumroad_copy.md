## Title Options:

**Option 1:** PhiVector – AI Automation Kit for Solo Operators

**Option 2:** PhiVector – Multi-Agent AI Coordination (No Enterprise Bullshit)

**Option 3:** PhiVector – AI Automation That Works The First Time

---

## Short Description (for listing):

Multi-agent AI coordination using PowerShell, file-based state, and zero-cost optimization. Built by a former bricklayer who thinks in pipelines. No dashboards, no SaaS, just scripts that work.

---

## Full Description:

### The fastest way to do something is to do it once. No matter how slow you are.

That was my boss's mantra for 15 years of bricklaying. Not the finest human, but he knew how to run a crew. We worked the least hours, did the most work, and pulled the least walls down.

Now I apply that thinking to AI automation.

**PhiVector** is a lean toolkit for coordinating multiple AI agents using simple scripts and files. No heavy framework. No corporate "AI platform". Just practical glue that does the job right the first time.

---

### What You Get

**Core System:**
- Multi-agent coordination (Desktop Claude, VS Code, WSL/Kali, Browser, Human-in-loop)
- File-based message bus (JSON in folders - easy to inspect and debug)
- PowerShell + AutoHotkey automation scripts
- Cost optimization patterns (free-tier rotation, token batching)

**Documentation:**
- Setup guide (one install, not five shells)
- Example workflows
- CASCADE Protocol (systematic problem-solving framework)
- Troubleshooting guide

**Bonus:**
- Terminal dashboard templates
- Logo assets (that chrome/green aesthetic you saw)
- Cost tracking scripts

---

### Who This Is For

- Solo hackers, indie devs, small operators
- People who hate repetitive bullshit
- Windows users comfortable with PowerShell
- Anyone who values **doing it once and doing it right**

### What It's Not

- Not a polished GUI product (unless the GUI actually helps)
- Not a "no-code platform"
- Not enterprise anything

---

### The Bricklaying Mindset

Bricklaying is **shitloads of effort**. But it teaches you to **min-max**:

- Stage your materials right
- Plan the sequence
- Execute clean
- Don't pull walls down

That's what PhiVector is built on: **maximum efficiency through doing it right the first time**.

---

### Why I Built This

23 days into learning AI automation, I got tired of:
- Clicking through dashboards
- Paying for enterprise features I don't need
- Dealing with 5 different installation processes
- Tools that break when you look at them wrong

So I built something that **just works**.

If you're the kind of person who'd rather spend an hour writing a script that works forever than spend 10 minutes a day clicking through the same bullshit, PhiVector is for you.

**Guarantee:** If it doesn't work for you, let me know and I'll help you fix it or refund you. No bullshit.
