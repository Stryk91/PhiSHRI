# PhiVector – AI Automation That Works The First Time

I was a bricklayer for 15 years. My boss had a mantra:

**"The fastest way to do something is to do it once. No matter how slow you are."**

Not the finest human alive, but damn... he knew how to run a crew. We worked the least hours, did the most work, and pulled the least walls down.

Now I apply that thinking to AI.

**PhiVector** is a lean automation kit that lets one person coordinate multiple AI agents using simple scripts and files. No heavy framework. No corporate "AI platform". Just practical glue that **does the job right the first time**.

## What You Get

A starting point for:

- **Multi-agent AI coordination**
  - Desktop AI (Claude etc.)
  - VS Code / code assistants
  - WSL/Kali / terminal agents
  - Browser-based AI
  - Human in the loop

- **File-based message bus**
  - Agents talk by dropping JSON into folders
  - Easy to inspect, debug, and extend
  - Works offline / locally

- **PowerShell / AutoHotkey automation**
  - Keyboard macros, window control, copy/paste, file ops
  - Scripted flows like:
    - "Open file → send to AI → write result → notify me"
    - "Scan folder → batch prompts → collect outputs"

- **Cost-aware patterns**
  - Free-tier rotation logic (burn provider A, then B, then C)
  - Token reduction via batching and shared context

- **Interoperability focus**
  - One install process, not five different shells
  - Clean interfaces when they serve a purpose
  - Scripts that work together without fighting

This is not a polished SaaS. It's a toolkit + patterns you can adapt.

## Who It's For

- Solo hackers, indie devs, small operators
- People comfortable with:
  - PowerShell / scripts
  - Editing config files
  - Trying things and breaking them
- People who value **doing it once and doing it right**

## What It's Not

- Not a polished GUI product (unless the GUI actually helps)
- Not a "no-code platform"
- Not enterprise anything

## The Bricklaying Mindset

Bricklaying is **shitloads of effort**. But it teaches you to **min-max**:

- Stage your materials right
- Plan the sequence
- Execute clean
- Don't pull walls down

That's what PhiVector is built on: **maximum efficiency through doing it right the first time**.

If you're the kind of person who'd rather spend an hour writing a script that works forever than spend 10 minutes a day clicking through the same bullshit, PhiVector is for you.
