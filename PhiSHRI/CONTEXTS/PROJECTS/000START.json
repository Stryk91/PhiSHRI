      "question": "How do I know which door to read first?",
      "answer": "Check the prerequisites field in any door. Lower-numbered doors (D01, W01, S01) are usually foundational. Follow the prerequisite chain for complete understanding."

    "q4": {
      "question": "What if a door references a PhiDEX path that doesn't exist?",

    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Should I read doors one at a time or in parallel?",
      "answer": "ALWAYS read multiple related doors in parallel (single message with multiple Read tool calls). System overhead is per-message, not per-file. Reading 5 doors in 1 message uses ~13K overhead. Reading 5 doors across 3 messages uses ~26K overhead. Parallel reading saves 30-50% tokens and is 2-3x faster."

    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I skip 000START if I already know the door codes?",
      "answer": "EXPERT MODE: Yes! If you know the door code patterns (D05-D14=deployment, W115-W131=messaging, S01-S18=security), go directly to doors. Saves ~3K tokens and 3-5 seconds. Trade-off: You miss related_doors recommendations and optimization tips. Beginners should always read 000START first."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Should I read INDEX.json or 000START for onboarding?",
      "answer": "INDEX.json (1.5K tokens) gives category overview and door counts. 000START.json (3.2K tokens) gives full onboarding with examples and FAQs. For quick category scan: INDEX.json. For first-time comprehensive guide: 000START.json. Saves ~1.7K tokens if you just need the overview."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "How many doors should I read for a quick answer vs comprehensive coverage?",
      "answer": "MINIMAL (2-3 doors, 4 seconds): Core topic only. COMPREHENSIVE (5-7 doors, 6 seconds): Includes related_doors for full picture. Example deployment: Minimal=D05,D06 (silent install + enterprise). Comprehensive=D05,D06,D07,D08,D13 (+ GPO, Autopilot, network optimization)."
