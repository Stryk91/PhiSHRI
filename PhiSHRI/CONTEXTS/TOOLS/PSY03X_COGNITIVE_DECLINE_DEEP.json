Decline is domain-specific - processing speed and episodic memory most vulnerable, semantic memory preserved\n3. Pathological decline is qualitatively different - functional impairment, rapid change, failure to benefit from support\n4. Cognitive reserve modifies expression - same pathology, different clinical presentation\n5. Prevention is possible - 40% of dementia cases potentially preventable through modifiable risk factors\n6. Comprehensive assessment requires multiple methods - testing, informant report, functional evaluation\n7. Intervention is multimodal - pharmacological, cognitive, lifestyle all have roles\n8. Earlier is better - for both assessment and intervention\n\n10.2 MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS (Lancet Commission 2020)\n\nEarly Life (5%):\n- Less education → Build educational opportunities, cognitive enrichment\n\nMidlife (15%):\n- Hearing loss → Treat hearing impairment, protect hearing\n- Traumatic brain injury → Prevent TBI (helmets, fall prevention)\n- Hypertension → Treat to target\n- Excessive alcohol → Moderate consumption (<21 units/week)\n- Obesity → Maintain healthy weight\n\nLate Life (20%):\n- Smoking → Never too late to quit\n- Depression → Treat depression\n- Social isolation → Maintain social engagement\n- Physical inactivity → Regular exercise\n- Diabetes → Glycemic control\n- Air pollution → Policy-level intervention\n\n10.3 RESEARCH PRIORITIES\n\n- Preclinical detection and intervention\n- Mechanism-based therapeutics beyond amyloid\n- Precision medicine approaches\n- Health equity in dementia research and care\n- Scalable lifestyle interventions\n- Caregiver support and dementia-friendly communities\n- Digital health tools for assessment and monitoring\n- Combined multimodal intervention optimization\n\n10.4 RESOURCES\n\nOrganizations:\n- Alzheimer's Association (alz.org)\n- Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)\n- National Institute on Aging (nia.nih.gov)\n- Lewy Body Dementia Association\n- Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration\n\nClinical Tools:\n- MoCA (mocatest.org)\n- NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery\n- NACC Uniform Data Set\n\nResearch Networks:\n- ACTC (Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium)\n- World-Wide FINGERS\n- DIAN (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network)",
