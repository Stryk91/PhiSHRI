Key shift: open source now matching closed on benchmarks. DeepSeek proved frontier performance at 10x lower cost. All labs pivoting to agentic + reasoning models. Infrastructure costs brutal (Oracle -45%). Regulation incoming (US national framework). PhiVector positioned well for local-first as consumer hardware improves.",
