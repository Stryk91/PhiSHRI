Patterns: API Gateway (entry point), Service Discovery (Consul, Eureka), Circuit Breaker (Hystrix, resilience4j), Saga (distributed transactions). Communication: sync (HTTP/gRPC) or async (Kafka, RabbitMQ). Benefits: independent deploy, tech diversity, scalability. Challenges: complexity, distributed data, network latency.",

API Gateway: single entry (Kong, AWS API Gateway), routes to services. Service Discovery: register services (Consul, Eureka), clients discover dynamically. Circuit Breaker: prevent cascading failures (Hystrix), fallback on timeout. Saga: distributed transactions (orchestration or choreography). Sync: HTTP/gRPC for request-reply. Async: Kafka/RabbitMQ for events. Deploy: Docker + K8s, each service in pod. Benefits: scale independently, deploy fast. Challenges: distributed tracing, eventual consistency, network overhead.",
