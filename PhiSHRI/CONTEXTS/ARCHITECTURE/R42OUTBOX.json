    "content": "Transactional outbox pattern.\n\nProblem:\nNeed to update DB and publish event atomically.\n\nSolution:\nWrite event to outbox table in same transaction, then publish asynchronously.\n\nFlow:\n1. Begin transaction\n2. Update business table\n3. Insert event to outbox table\n4. Commit transaction\n5. Background: Read outbox, publish, mark as sent\n\nBenefits:\n- At-least-once delivery guaranteed\n- No distributed transaction needed\n- Handles publisher failures\n\nConsiderations:\n- Outbox polling or CDC\n- Event ordering within aggregate\n- Duplicate handling (idempotency)",
